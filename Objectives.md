# Objectives of Hidden OS Project
The intent of this document is to provide gudiance and objectives for the iScholars Hidden OS project in collaboration with Booz Allen.

## Overview
### Hiding Operating Systems in Plain Sight:
The goal is to come up with a solution for running multiple operating systems on a device â€“ with one of those operating systems being hidden and protected from attackers. The hidden operating system could be a virtual machine, dual partition, or other ideas but they should be hard (ideally impossible) to detect. Also, come up with secure and creative ways to access that operating system without others being able to replicate it.
