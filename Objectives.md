# Objectives of Hidden OS Project
The intent of this document is to provide gudiance and objectives for the iScholars Hidden OS project in collaboration with Booz Allen.

## Overview
### Hiding Operating Systems in Plain Sight:
The goal is to come up with a solution for running multiple operating systems on a device â€“ with one of those operating systems being hidden and protected from attackers. The hidden operating system could be a virtual machine, dual partition, or other ideas but they should be hard (ideally impossible) to detect. Also, come up with secure and creative ways to access that operating system without others being able to replicate it.

## Objectives
* Hidden OS - Choosing a System  
  * Build familiarity with open source Operating Systems
  * Choose an operating system to act as the "hidden OS" - the host will be Windows 10 
* Hidden OS - Credential Management
  * How will the OS be accessed from the host?
  * How will we authenticate the user?
  * How do we prevent non-authenticated users from accessing the "hidden OS"?
* Hidden OS - Masking
  * The OS should be hard/impossible to detect
    * How can we hide an OS in plain site? 
    * How can we minimize it's footprint to prevent detection while running?
    * How do we store the OS on the device while keeping it secure and undetectable?
