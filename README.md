Virginia Tech and BAH IScholars OS Project - Hidden OS and Mobile Device Management

## Hiding Operating Systems in Plain Sight: 
The goal is to come up with a solution for running multiple operating systems on a device â€“ with one of those operating systems being hidden and protected from attackers.  The hidden operating system could be a virtual machine, dual partition, or other ideas but they should be hard (ideally impossible) to detect.  Also, come up with secure and creative ways to access that operating system without others being able to replicate it.

## Mobile Device Management of the Future: 
Mobile device management has been used as the main security solution for controlling sensitive and classified devices.  This effort will look at the leading mobile device management solutions on the market to determine valuable features, analyze requirements for protecting classified data, and ideate on innovative features to create the next generation of mobile device management solutions.
